# Tokenomics



## **Max Supply: 90,000 $NewB**

NewB.Farm started with no pre-farm and pre-liquidity providers with the support of 10 LFC global community, we will have roughly around 2 - 3 million USD for NewB Vaults once launched.&#x20;

To ensure fair distribution of $NewB, only vault users (non-turbo vaults) will be able to mine $NewB tokens in addition to the yields from auto-compounding vaults.

## **Details:**

**Deflationary Tokenomics: **Vault fees (15%) on vault users' profits are used to perform market buy-backs and these $NewB are burnt out of supply forever in the near future.

**Utility:**

* _Receive fees from cross-chain vaults_
* _Receive fees from DEX aggregator_
* _Governance_
