# Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

[Binance Smart Chain](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/an-introduction-to-binance-smart-chain-bsc) is a decentralized and cost-efficient public chain that Ethereum developers can easily get started with and smart contracts are seamlessly compatible. The network uses a modified version of proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus known as a proof-of-staked-authority (PoSA) algorithm.

You can use it via a web interface at [binance.org](https://binance.org) or through its native integration with [Trust Wallet](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-trust-wallet) and [Safepal](https://www.safepal.io).
